##Summary

What is the highest and best use of a business analyst or a business data analyst? 
- To find out the right question to ask.
   What is always the right question? Answer: What change, in our business processes can and should we make right now to increase revenues, maximize profitability, or reduce our risk.
- find the best answer you possibly can in the time, and with the resources available. 

Ensuring that your answer has practical impact by:
- translating it into a specific call to action
- a specific recommended action,
- communicated to the relevant decision makers
- using visual metaphors and non technical language.

What do we mean by “right now”? 

1.	Ideally realtime,
2.	Just in Time,
3.	No immediate change. Gather data by AB testing

All business metrics can be classified into three broad categories:

1.	Revenue metrics, relate to sales and marketing. For optimistic extroverts;
2.	Profitability metrics, relate to efficiency and logistics, production, and operations. For fastidious perfectionists;
3.	Risk metrics, relate to risk management, and are widely used by a company's creditors and outside investors. For informed skeptics.

Traditional business metrics, i.e.
- quarterly statements of net cash flow, profits and losses,
- changes to balance sheet items such as shareholder's equity.

Dynamic Business Metrics:
- changes significantly over intervals of a month or less;
- there are specific actions the company can take that can visibly or significantly impact the metric in the short term
- twitchy: Small changes in process, in our process, can lead to big impact.

The key enterprise sales metrics are:
- New leads.
- New qualified leads.
- Expressions of interest.
- Meetings with the correct decision maker.
- Getting the decision making to say yes, that's a soft circle sale.
- And then the number of actual official binding contract sales.

There are 4 main reasons why inventory time should be minimized.

Approximation of average days inventory:  
VoI = the value of inventory on hand at the end of the year  
C_annual = the total annual cost of goods sold  
I_average = average days inventory  

I_average = 365*VoI/C_annual

Sources of business risk:
- The most common sources of business risk seem to stem from excessive leverage. 
- Another type of risk is reputational, damage to your brand and ability to sell in the future.
