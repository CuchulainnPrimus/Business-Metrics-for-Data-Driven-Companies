##Introduction to Course One: Business Metrics data driven companies

*Daniel Egger*

Question - What will you be able to do after you complete this course: Business metrics for data driven companies? At least four things.

With module two, you'll be able to distinguish the numbers that are vital to the health and success of a business- business metrics from the flood of other, less useful data that surrounds every business. You'll be able to classify any business metric. First, you'll be able to distinguish which of the three main categories of business data a metric falls into:

1.	revenue,
2.	profitability or
3.	risk.

And you will be able to distinguish traditional metrics from what we call here dynamic metrics: metrics often quite new that offer the greatest potential to lead the innovation through rapid business process improvement.

With module three, you'll be able to anticipate what types of data-centric employees are needed in different types of businesses, the typical job titles and skill requirements you will find in each type of company, as well as how employees in different roles typically interact with one another. In particular, you'll hear directly from business analysts, business data analysts, data scientists, and senior software engineers involved in data related work. We'll classify all companies into five categories, and consider how each category is responding to the impact of big data. You'll even be able to score your own company, or any other company, individually on a 20 item checklist to determine how well it is embracing big data analytic culture.

After module four, you'll be able to identify what are currently corporate best practices in analyzing business metrics. You'll learn some simple but powerful formulas to extract maximum value from those metrics. We'll look at a critically important horizontal business area, web-based marketing, which is relevant to almost every company in the business world. And we'll explore a representative vertical market, financial services related to investing and portfolio management, so that you can get familiar with how a group of metrics work together to define a market sector.

The overall goal of our business analytic specialization is to prepare you for success if you choose to work as a business analyst or business data analyst, or if you plan to embark on a career path that leads to becoming a data scientist, or simply wish to be effective in your current role as data plays an ever more central role in business processes. Whatever your role, learning how to work productively as business analysts or business data analysts is highly useful in our opinion. The world appears to be flooded with an ocean of data, much of it not so useful. After you've taken this course, you will be able to find the treasure in that ocean; to identify and utilize the key metrics that allow data driven companies to thrive.
