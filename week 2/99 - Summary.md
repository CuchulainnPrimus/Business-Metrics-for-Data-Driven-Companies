##Summary

Four main types of roles, which we've listed under four different job titles:
- Business analyst, entry level
- business data analyst, entry level
- data scientist, requires additional skills and work experience
- senior software engineer or technical project manager, requires different training and requirements compared to other roles

Five types of companies, based on their fundamental relationship to big data:

1. Strategic consulting firms with a general business focus,  
2. traditional bricks-and-mortar companies in all industries,  
3. strategic consulting firms with an information technology or systems integration focus,  
4. companies selling hardware and software, or software as a service for gathering, storing, analyzing, and using big data. And  
5. digital businesses, where the core of the company's value creation involves real-time analysis of data.

requirements all of these jobs have in common, broken down into seven areas.

1 - ability to identify the most important and relevant business metrics for a specific business. This is local knowledge of the industry sector where a particular company is active;	
2 - ability to apply appropriate models to analyze those metrics. Models are ways we represent a real world situation in simplified mathematical form;	
3 - Ability to Quantify the effectiveness of models used;	
4 - Ability to listen, to interview customers internal or external to define project requirements;	
5 - Basic Excel Skills, including the ability to identify patterns and trends in business data, make forecasts, organize financial information and display conclusions in charts and graphs. And more intermediate Excel skills, such as the ability to import and manage large data sets, develop and test different models, and run optimizations using solver;	
6 - Presentation Skills. Effective, meaning clear, concise, and persuasive, verbal and written communication using PowerPoint;	
7 - The ability to use data visualizations to make your conclusions and recommendations intuitive to a non-technical audience.

The business data analyst’s role, differs from the business analyst’s role in two main ways. 

1 - The business data analyst is expected to be able to think flexibly, about how the data a company is currently collecting could be recombined, and analyzed in new ways to understand the business better; where business analyst, is generally given a specific problem to analyze based on information that has been assembled by someone else. A business data analyst may need to be able to pull together information from data sources scattered throughout the company, and should be able to figure out where to go in the organization, to find the relevant data. In other words, a business data analyst should be able to figure out the right questions to ask, in order to identify opportunities for business process changes that may be suggested by the data.	
2 - While a business analyst is generally given a readymade data set, or a problem definition. A business data analyst is expected to be able to run SQL, or structured query language, queries to pull useful data out of much larger databases or even from distributed collections of unstructured data, scattered in multiple locations within the organization. And to combine that polled data into new data sets that did not previously exist, to support the data analyst's research agenda. This level of autonomy and self sufficiency greatly increases the productivity of a business data analyst, and allows them much greater room for creativity, because they can explore hunches or pursue leads that may not turn into anything without burdening other employees, who would otherwise need to gather and scrub or recombine the necessary data for them. 

Data scientist is a newly emerging leadership role, interdisciplinary, and with constantly evolving scope. Data scientists are the people who grasp what is possible from big data in terms of dramatically improved business processes and can translate a company’s business names and needs into database architecture and software engineering terms and can translate the needs and concerns of engineers into terms the company's non-technical management can understand.

In the past ten years the following three elements have become key for business survival:

1. Modeling, machine learning and forecasting.	
2. An environment in which key business process data is continually captured and stored, analyzed, updated, shared throughout the organization.	
3. Data is received by decision-makers on a real time or just-in-time basis.

Requirements for becoming a data scientist begin with the same skills required of a business data analyst. But data scientists are expected to be familiar with a large number of additional technologies and concepts as well. Data scientists are expected to be masters of the big picture, understanding how different tools and technologies can be integrated to form a coherent whole. We've identified eight skill areas that data scientists are expected to have that go beyond the nine already expected of a business data analyst.

1 - more advanced modeling tools. Intermediate to advanced knowledge of at least one of R, Matlab, or SAS.	
2 - Advanced statistical methods. Most data scientists have taken at least one calculus-level probability and statistical inference course, either at university or online.	
3 - Bayesian learning and probabilistic models, machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics. The way machines learn from data is captured well by Bayesian assumptions and Bayesian methods. Almost all real-time decision systems rely on machine learning to ensure that decisions reflect the latest data inputs.	
4 - Additional relational database skills, including at a minimum, how to populate, that means to put data into and optimize, making pulling out data fast, SQL databases.	
5 - Intermediate knowledge of the most important technologies used to communicate between the customer layers, typically the web browser or mobile app and the database layer. The tools are Python, Java and JavaScript.	 
6 - Experience managing distributed and unstructured data including tools like Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, and Spark. 	
7 - Basic knowledge of tools and methods for natural-language processing for applications such as sentiment analysis. 	
8 - Experience with massively scalable cloud-based data hosting and processing, either with Amazon Web Services, AWS, or with one of its nearest competitors such as Microsoft Azure or the Google Compute layer.	

None of the nine skills that we discussed earlier as being required by all business data analysts are part of the regular skill set of software engineers. A data scientist's knowledge of modeling tools, statistical methods and machine learning is also unnecessary. On the other hand, software engineers do share with data scientists knowledge of languages for scripting such as Python, Java and JavaScript. As well as Tools like Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, and Spark for handling and retrieving unstructured data. Some experience with natural language processing tools. And with cloud based services such as AWS are also shared and common. Software engineers leading the system's engineering and product management for big data projects will also typically have skills in the following five additional areas.

1 - Experience with lower level languages, such as C++. 	
2 - Knowledge of highly scalable, low latency commercial relational databases such as Oracle and Teradata. 	
3 - Experience leading software development teams. 	
4 - Experience with project management including scheduling and budgeting for software development. 	
5 - Experience working with real time and third party data feeds. 

We've organized all US companies into five groups. They are ranked from most likely to least likely to be hiring for entry level business analyst positions, as opposed to be hiring for more technical software development roles. 

1 - The traditional strategic business consulting firms. Their business model is that they are paid for advice. They generally focus on ways to improve business processes: increase revenues, maximize profitability, and reduce risk. 	
2 - Traditional businesses in all market sectors. These are often referred to as brick-and-mortar companies in contrast to digital companies that compete in the same markets but with completely different business models, and often with much lower cost structures.  	
3 - a small number of strategic business consulting firms that also recommend business process changes, but they specialize in building or installing custom software systems to implement their recommendations. These firms have outsize influence on the market for data analytics, because Fortune 500 companies tend to follow their advice. 	
4 - Hardware and software companies. These are the critical companies that together provide the products, and services to gather, store, manage, search, process, analyze, visualize and report the world's data. 	 
5 - Digital companies. They compete primarily against established players in traditional markets. Digital companies also create market sectors with no real equivalent before the internet, like Google and search or eBay and online auctions. All digital companies rely upon massive data processing, generally enhanced by machine learning systems to make real-time decisions. At the heart of their value proposition is business analytics. 


Strategic business consulting firms provide expert advice about best practices to companies that want to stay competitive in the constantly changing conditions of the global digital economy. Much of a strategic consulting company's work is based on collecting and analyzing data and using that data to recommend business process changes to their clients. The largest firms of this type are 
- Deloitte Consulting
- McKinsey
- Boston Consulting Group
- Bain

Mostly, the data that the business analysts work with belongs to a client. Technical staff at either the consulting firm or the client extracts data that the client already has stored in various databases, but is not using dynamically. They provide it to the business analyst, typically in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. The business analyst studies it and applies various models to discover opportunities for business process improvement.

A variation on this situation is the specialized group of consulting firms that have developed their own proprietary databases and related predictive models about a particular industry or market sector. These consulting firms tend to need more business data analysts and some data scientists as well. Examples of this type of consulting firm are credit bureaus which collect information about people's debts and payment history. And sell that information to banks and others offering credit to help them decide, whether they should risk a loan with that person. 
- Equifax
- TransUnion
- and Experian.
- FICO. uses the data originally gathered by the credit bureaus to generate a single number, the FICO score, that predicts credit worthiness. 
- comScore, Tracking web and mobile click streams, with user permission, comScore observes how much traffic goes where and as a kind of Nielsen rating for the web. comScore quote, measures what people do when they navigate the digital world.
- Argus Information and Advisory services, combines credit card transactions, balances and payments across most ofthe credit cards in the industry. Argus builds models about consumerbehavior, segmenting potential customers and helping banks with marketingpromotions for new credit cards. As well as with managing credit risk. Argus revenue's are notbroken out separately. 

Certain sectors of the traditional bricks and mortar economy are presently under serious threat from digital companies. These sectors have the most to gain by adopting best practices for business analytics and the most to lose from failing to move. Threatened sectors include, but are not limited to:
- All forms of consumer retail purchases, including books, movies, music, fashion, electronics, groceries, household supplies.
- Financial services, including issuing credit cards, making other types of unsecured loans to individuals and small businesses, payment processing, and managing other people's money as an investment advisor.
- Real estate, in particular, short-term lodging such as hotel rooms.
- Logistics and transportation, in particular, local taxi industries around the world.

Here is a checklist you can use to evaluate how far along a company is in embracing big data culture. This checklist has a total of 20 items. 19 items are relevant to product companies and 14 to service companies. Over time, this checklist will no doubt evolve. It represents the state of the industry in 2015 to 2016.	

1. Offer a mobile version of its website tested for rapid loading times in all the world markets. Does it use edge caching, content delivery network, such as Akamai? Can you buy products and services directly from mobile apps for Android and iOS as well as the web?	
2. Track your visitor's full click stream. The exact path through the website with time spent at each point, rather than just count unique visitors or page views.	
3. Define conversion of new website visitors in two steps. First, individuals register and provide name and email, and second, they become revenue generating customers.	
4. Do ongoing A/B testing of site features to optimize rates of conversion to revenue.	
5. Know how to achieve and maintain a high Google Adrank.	
6. Know the maximum price per click-through for web advertising that is profitable. This requires knowing both the conversion rate to revenues per click-through, and the average lifetime value of a new customer.	
7. Give customers a meaningful and effective incentive to interact with the company online between store visits. Ideally make real-time online promotional {offers} to individuals based on a preference analysis of their specific history.	
8. And this is for product companies only, allowed companies to see what is on the shelf in their local store while online.	
9. Again for product companies, allow customers to order ahead of time and pick up at the store.	
10. Really what you {want to} do is, collaborate with third-party shopping and delivery services, to enable same-day or less deliveries from the nearest store, for product {companies}.	
11. The equivalent for service companies, number eleven, is to make sure that whatever service you provide; you're doing it and completing the service delivery as fast as your online competitors. So for example, if {you’re} making loans: does the person borrowing receive the money as fast as they do from your online competition?	
12. Track all interactions with a customer, sales, complaints, web interactions, located under a single customer record ID in a database. And have that information available on a, quote, “just in time basis when interacting with a customer.”	
13. Identify opportunities for recurring revenue through value added membership and loyalty programs, like Costco membership or Amazon Prime.	
14. Have point-of-sale customization. For example, custom coupons for additional products or services aimed at a particular customer's past purchase interests that are available to them when they check out.	
15. Develop customer incentives to reward and cultivate your highest-spending, repeat customers, what they call in Las Vegas, the whales, or air travelers with executive platinum.	
16. Continually track churn rates and follow up with special incentives to lure back customers who have gone quiet for a {set} period.	
17. For product companies only, track all SKU's at the store level to prevent excessive days inventory.	
18. Product companies, track all zero-inventory items to eliminate empty shelves. Do research to identify products customers wanted that are not carried.	
19. For product companies, vary inventory levels for individual items by store, region, season, even day of the week, to balance minimizing days inventory and wastage against not running out.	
20. Offer effective price reduction and last minute promotion programs to sell any wasting inventory, whether products or services like hotel rooms or airline tickets.

So here's how you can score your company:
- For product companies, 16 or more out of 19 is very good to excellent. 14 out of 19 is good, but needs improvement. 11 out of 19 is passing, and fewer than that your company is lagging and needs to consider changing its business culture, or simply withdrawing from markets that face digital competition.
- For service companies we have 14 that apply. Ten or more out of 14 is very good to excellent. I'd say 8 to 10 is good, but needs improvement, 7 passing, and 6 or fewer, the company, again, is lagging and needs to change its business culture or consider withdrawing from the digital markets where it is competing.

A second type of strategic business consulting firm focuses on offering advice about changing business processes. That includes recommendations for the consultant to help the client build and install new information technology infrastructure. IT focused consulting companies are a small segment but they are one of the most important forces driving the worldwide adoption of big data culture. They need some business data analysts but even more they need data scientists and teams of experienced software engineers.

- The world leader in this market is Ireland-based Accenture, with US$32 billion in revenues. 
- Other examples of companies in the same space include Palantir based in Palo Alto, California and Opera Solutions based in New York City. In its own words, “Palantir specializes in analysis, but we don't actually do the analysis ourselves, we write software that enables experts in their respective fields to extract insight from information,” unquote.
- Opera Solutions, also founded in 2004, in its own words, quote, “..applies advanced analytics to big data flows to extract predictive patterns,” unquote. 

Stepping away to look at the big picture; what information technology consulting firms do, is introduce the technologically newest methods for achieving competitive advantage into a particular vertical market, such as retail grocery stores. They identify one company in that market with an early adopter culture; a company willing to take some risks in return for the potential advantage of having new technology implemented first. Let's say that first company does successfully implement some form of better data driven decision making and it starts to generate higher revenues or better profit margins. Now, that company's direct competitors have no real choice but to upgrade their own IT systems or face disruption. The same strategic consulting firm that helped the first company now has a much easier time selling the same type of technology solution to the first companies direct competitors. Soon all surviving companies in a sector have roughly the same type of information technology capability and the endless cycle of upgrades repeats. Buzzwords tend to surround these upgrades and big data is the biggest buzzword of all, but in this case the hype is justified.

The companies that we've chosen to identify as digital companies are some of the leaders at using new business models to disrupt traditional markets or forge entirely new markets. These companies are driven by developing new information technology; both software and business analytics for their own internal use. Mostly, products or services they sell can be offered better, faster, cheaper, than their competitors, because of their superior grasp of real-time data processing and machine learning. Because they are architecting entirely new systems, these companies need software engineers and, to a lesser extent, data scientists. They have relatively less need for business analysts and business data analysts.
Amazon has completely transformed multiple retail industries, starting with books, moving on to electronics and other goods. But recently, its biggest impact has been in the hosted storage and processing business known as Amazon Web Services, or AWS. 

Many Internet companies offer information and services for free, and make their money by selling targeting advertising, or better positioning within search results. These companies use analytics both to make their services as useful and attractive as possible, and also to identify users toward whom to target specific advertising campaigns. Leaders in the ad supported, free to users category, are of course
- first Google, where over US$50 billion of their US$69.8 billion in revenue is from targeted advertising and second, 
- Facebook with $13.5 billion in 2014 revenue, primarily from advertising. 
- Third, LinkedIn with multiple revenue streams, but at least 20% of its US$2.9 billion in revenue from targeted advertising. 
- A fourth digital information company, dominating the residential real estate rental and sales listings real estate information in metric sector is Zillow, with US$386 million in revenues, largely from advertising and placements.

Two companies that have generated tremendous attention for their innovative sharing economy business models, and are equally impressive for their use of data analytics, are Uber and airbnb. 
- Uber competes against traditional taxi companies. Uber digitally links drivers with people needing rides, allowing each to see reviews of the other and allowing passengers to see a map of how far away the nearest Uber car is, and how long the soonest available will take to arrive as well as getting a committed fixed price from Uber for a journey to a specified address, before they set out. Uber also charges more when demand for cars exceeds supply, a variable pricing method to optimize clearing of inventory of available cars. Uber drivers own their own cars and work as independent contractors, so Uber has minimal capital expenditure. Uber takes a 20% commission for matching drivers and passengers. Uber's commission revenue is expected to exceed US$2 billion dollars in 2015, on US$10 billion in gross spending by passengers.
- Airbnb competes with traditional hotels. Airbnb, which matches property owners who wish to rent out a vacant apartment or even a room with travelers who are looking for a more personal travel experience. Also provides mutual reviews of owners and renters. Provides detailed mapping functionality to identify what is available in a given region, and provides owners with predictive analytics tools to optimize their revenue based on location, day of the week, time of the year, etc. Airbnb collects a commission that averages 11% on room rentals: so, about US$420 million in revenues on about US$4 billion in bookings in 2014.

Hardware and software companies have use for a few business data analysts and data scientists but their primary need is for skilled software engineers and technical project managers. Their company's value depends upon the efficient development and delivery of proprietary technology.

Hardware and software have unusual price dynamics. Technology has high fixed costs to develop, and variable costs that are often close to zero. The first salable copy of a complex enterprise software application might cost US$5 million to develop. But the second copy, and every additional copy, might cost a penny, essentially. A new semiconductor chip may be fab-produced in a fabrication plant that costs US$5 billion to build, but the variable cost of a single chip off of that assembly line is only the cost of the raw material, maybe a few cents worth of clean sand.

Big data culture is possible only because of today's extremely low costs for storing and processing electronic information. Today's absurdly low computing costs are the result of 50 years of ferocious price wars in commercial hardware and software markets; markets that are driven by the unusual dynamic of high fixed cost and very low variable costs. Price wars tend to drive any commodity, product, or service down to prices close to variable cost. 

To survive, hardware and software companies either need to figure out how to be the absolute lowest cost provider of a commodity good or service, or they need to dominate a value added branded niche so effectively that when a lower cost alternative inevitable appears the perceived cost of switching away from the dominant brand outweigh the benefits.

Information technology infrastructure is often described in terms of a stack. Our very simplified IP stack has only three layers: at the base, hardware, computers and routers, in the middle, databases and enterprise software and at the top, desktop commercial software.

At the base of the stack is hardware, chips and other components assembled into machines, servers, and routers. At this level are semi-conductor chip companies led by Intel with revenues of US$55 billion, and also including Texas Instruments with revenues of US$13 billion, and AMD with revenues of US$4.6 billion. Cisco, the leading provider of Internet routers, has revenues of US$49 billion.

A very unusual hardware company is Apple, with revenues of US$224 billion, the largest IT company in the world. In fact, by market capitalization, Apple is twice as big as the world's next largest company, ExxonMobil. Apple is famous for its successful control of the entire stack from chips and monitors through the operating system, applications' look and feel, mobile devices and all the way to proprietary value-added services like iTunes and its own cloud storage.

In the middle layer of the stack are enterprise, scalable operating systems, web server software, big relational and distributed databases, and of course, big enterprise software applications. This is software only professionals interact with. User-friendly interfaces tend to be non-existent, and little if any thought is given to making the projects intuitive or easy to use. The primary goal at this layer is scalability, and of course security. Leaders at the enterprise software level are IBM with revenues of US$86 billion, primarily focused on building enterprise systems for companies; then Oracle with revenues of US$38 billion for large databases that can handle high simultaneous traffic, and for enterprise software in the human resources, customer relationship management, finance and supply chain segments. Next, SAP which has US$21 billion in revenues for supply chain and finance systems. A smaller player and one of Oracle's last surviving competitors in commercial databases is Teradata with US$2.7 billion in revenues. Symantec, which makes enterprise security software, had US$6.7 billion in revenues. VMware, which makes enterprise software that allows multiple operating systems and concurrent users on a single machine's hardware, had US$6 billion in revenues.

An interesting hybrid company offering very complex enterprise-level software to manage all aspects of customer relationship management and the sale process, but offering their software exclusively as a hosted service, is www.salesforce.com with US$4.1 billion in revenues.

Then comes the third layer; user-friendly commercial desktop software applications that allow knowledge workers to access and work with company data. This level is currently dominated by Microsoft with revenues of US$86 billion for Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and the rest. Slightly more technical statistics and modeling packages include SAS, with revenues of approximately US$4 billion, and MATLAB, which is privately held, owned by MathWorks, with approximately US$750 million in revenues. Also data visualization tools like Tableau with revenues of US$468 million, and digital imaging process tools like Adobe Photoshop with revenues of US$4.35 {billion}.

All these hardware and software companies have big data strategies. Microsoft is moving into the hosted software as a service space that is currently dominated by Amazon web services. IBM and Oracle both have cloud offerings. IBM even hosts SAP enterprise applications in the cloud. All of these companies are trying to remake themselves as offering just-in-time and real-time data for human or computer driven decision making. Most have extensive machine learning and predictive analytics initiatives, for example, IBM's Watson and Microsoft's Azure projects.
