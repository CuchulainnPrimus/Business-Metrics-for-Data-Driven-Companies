##Summary

Four main types of roles, which we've listed under four different job titles:
- Business analyst, entry level
- business data analyst, entry level
- data scientist, requires additional skills and work experience
- senior software engineer or technical project manager, requires different training and requirements compared to other roles

Five types of companies, based on their fundamental relationship to big data:

1. Strategic consulting firms with a general business focus,  
2. traditional bricks-and-mortar companies in all industries,  
3. strategic consulting firms with an information technology or systems integration focus,  
4. companies selling hardware and software, or software as a service for gathering, storing, analyzing, and using big data. And  
5. digital businesses, where the core of the company's value creation involves real-time analysis of data.

requirements all of these jobs have in common, broken down into seven areas.

1 - ability to identify the most important and relevant business metrics for a specific business. This is local knowledge of the industry sector where a particular company is active; 
2 - ability to apply appropriate models to analyze those metrics. Models are ways we represent a real world situation in simplified mathematical form; 
3 - Ability to Quantify the effectiveness of models used; 
4 - Ability to listen, to interview customers internal or external to define project requirements; 
5 - Basic Excel Skills, including the ability to identify patterns and trends in business data, make forecasts, organize financial information and display conclusions in charts and graphs. And more intermediate Excel skills, such as the ability to import and manage large data sets, develop and test different models, and run optimizations using solver; 
6 - Presentation Skills. Effective, meaning clear, concise, and persuasive, verbal and written communication using PowerPoint; 
7 - The ability to use data visualizations to make your conclusions and recommendations intuitive to a non-technical audience.

The business data analyst’s role, differs from the business analyst’s role in two main ways. 

1 - The business data analyst is expected to be able to think flexibly, about how the data a company is currently collecting could be recombined, and analyzed in new ways to understand the business better; where business analyst, is generally given a specific problem to analyze based on information that has been assembled by someone else. A business data analyst may need to be able to pull together information from data sources scattered throughout the company, and should be able to figure out where to go in the organization, to find the relevant data. In other words, a business data analyst should be able to figure out the right questions to ask, in order to identify opportunities for business process changes that may be suggested by the data. 
2 - While a business analyst is generally given a readymade data set, or a problem definition. A business data analyst is expected to be able to run SQL, or structured query language, queries to pull useful data out of much larger databases or even from distributed collections of unstructured data, scattered in multiple locations within the organization. And to combine that polled data into new data sets that did not previously exist, to support the data analyst's research agenda. This level of autonomy and self sufficiency greatly increases the productivity of a business data analyst, and allows them much greater room for creativity, because they can explore hunches or pursue leads that may not turn into anything without burdening other employees, who would otherwise need to gather and scrub or recombine the necessary data for them. 

Data scientist is a newly emerging leadership role, interdisciplinary, and with constantly evolving scope. Data scientists are the people who grasp what is possible from big data in terms of dramatically improved business processes and can translate a company’s business names and needs into database architecture and software engineering terms and can translate the needs and concerns of engineers into terms the company's non-technical management can understand.

In the past ten years the following three elements have become key for business survival:

1. Modeling, machine learning and forecasting. 
2. An environment in which key business process data is continually captured and stored, analyzed, updated, shared throughout the organization. 
3. Data is received by decision-makers on a real time or just-in-time basis.

Requirements for becoming a data scientist begin with the same skills required of a business data analyst. But data scientists are expected to be familiar with a large number of additional technologies and concepts as well. Data scientists are expected to be masters of the big picture, understanding how different tools and technologies can be integrated to form a coherent whole. We've identified eight skill areas that data scientists are expected to have that go beyond the nine already expected of a business data analyst.

1 - more advanced modeling tools. Intermediate to advanced knowledge of at least one of R, Matlab, or SAS. 
2 - Advanced statistical methods. Most data scientists have taken at least one calculus-level probability and statistical inference course, either at university or online. 
3 - Bayesian learning and probabilistic models, machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics. The way machines learn from data is captured well by Bayesian assumptions and Bayesian methods. Almost all real-time decision systems rely on machine learning to ensure that decisions reflect the latest data inputs. 
4 - Additional relational database skills, including at a minimum, how to populate, that means to put data into and optimize, making pulling out data fast, SQL databases. 
5 - Intermediate knowledge of the most important technologies used to communicate between the customer layers, typically the web browser or mobile app and the database layer. The tools are Python, Java and JavaScript. 
6 - Experience managing distributed and unstructured data including tools like Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, and Spark. 
7 - Basic knowledge of tools and methods for natural-language processing for applications such as sentiment analysis. 
8 - Experience with massively scalable cloud-based data hosting and processing, either with Amazon Web Services, AWS, or with one of its nearest competitors such as Microsoft Azure or the Google Compute layer.

None of the nine skills that we discussed earlier as being required by all business data analysts are part of the regular skill set of software engineers. A data scientist's knowledge of modeling tools, statistical methods and machine learning is also unnecessary. On the other hand, software engineers do share with data scientists knowledge of languages for scripting such as Python, Java and JavaScript. As well as Tools like Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, and Spark for handling and retrieving unstructured data. Some experience with natural language processing tools. And with cloud based services such as AWS are also shared and common. Software engineers leading the system's engineering and product management for big data projects will also typically have skills in the following five additional areas.

1 - Experience with lower level languages, such as C++. 
2 - Knowledge of highly scalable, low latency commercial relational databases such as Oracle and Teradata. 
3 - Experience leading software development teams. 
4 - Experience with project management including scheduling and budgeting for software development. 
5 - Experience working with real time and third party data feeds. 

We've organized all US companies into five groups. They are ranked from most likely to least likely to be hiring for entry level business analyst positions, as opposed to be hiring for more technical software development roles. 

1 - The traditional strategic business consulting firms. Their business model is that they are paid for advice. They generally focus on ways to improve business processes: increase revenues, maximize profitability, and reduce risk. 
2 - Traditional businesses in all market sectors. These are often referred to as brick-and-mortar companies in contrast to digital companies that compete in the same markets but with completely different business models, and often with much lower cost structures.  
3 - a small number of strategic business consulting firms that also recommend business process changes, but they specialize in building or installing custom software systems to implement their recommendations. These firms have outsize influence on the market for data analytics, because Fortune 500 companies tend to follow their advice. 
4 - Hardware and software companies. These are the critical companies that together provide the products, and services to gather, store, manage, search, process, analyze, visualize and report the world's data.  
5 - Digital companies. They compete primarily against established players in traditional markets. Digital companies also create market sectors with no real equivalent before the internet, like Google and search or eBay and online auctions. All digital companies rely upon massive data processing, generally enhanced by machine learning systems to make real-time decisions. At the heart of their value proposition is business analytics. 


Strategic business consulting firms provide expert advice about best practices to companies that want to stay competitive in the constantly changing conditions of the global digital economy. Much of a strategic consulting company's work is based on collecting and analyzing data and using that data to recommend business process changes to their clients. The largest firms of this type are 
- Deloitte Consulting
- McKinsey
- Boston Consulting Group
- Bain

Mostly, the data that the business analysts work with belongs to a client. Technical staff at either the consulting firm or the client extracts data that the client already has stored in various databases, but is not using dynamically. They provide it to the business analyst, typically in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. The business analyst studies it and applies various models to discover opportunities for business process improvement.

A variation on this situation is the specialized group of consulting firms that have developed their own proprietary databases and related predictive models about a particular industry or market sector. These consulting firms tend to need more business data analysts and some data scientists as well. Examples of this type of consulting firm are credit bureaus which collect information about people's debts and payment history. And sell that information to banks and others offering credit to help them decide, whether they should risk a loan with that person. 
- Equifax
- TransUnion
- and Experian.
- FICO. uses the data originally gathered by the credit bureaus to generate a single number, the FICO score, that predicts credit worthiness. 
- comScore, Tracking web and mobile click streams, with user permission, comScore observes how much traffic goes where and as a kind of Nielsen rating for the web. comScore quote, measures what people do when they navigate the digital world.
- Argus Information and Advisory services, combines credit card transactions, balances and payments across most ofthe credit cards in the industry. Argus builds models about consumerbehavior, segmenting potential customers and helping banks with marketingpromotions for new credit cards. As well as with managing credit risk. Argus revenue's are notbroken out separately.
