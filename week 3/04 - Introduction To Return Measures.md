##Introduction To Return Measures (Transcript Section 1)

Money managers are professional investors who are paid to generate a return on other people's money. The money management industry has its own specialized metrics for investment returns in general and for manager's performance in particular.

We will now discuss returns and volatility of returns. Asset returns are calculated in three main ways. For a one-time investment, that pays off in the future, the absolute and annual rates of return can be calculated, either as a continually compounded, or as a {discrete} rate of return. Both continuously compounded, and {discrete} are acceptable metrics, but because the two metrics will not give the same result, in order to get a meaningful apples to apples comparison, always use the same method when comparing two or more returns.

The first method, which calculates the continuously compounded return involves taking the log, to the base e. Usually written as a natural log ln of the ratio of the final price divided by the first price.

```
Continuous Absolute Return = log_e (Final Price/Initial Price) = ln (Final Price/Initial Price) 
```
And this will give us a value for the absolute return. So, if we started with $100 and we ended up with $130, natural log of 1.3, this gives us .2624 or 26.24% for the absolute return over the two year period.
```
ln ($130/$100) = 0.2624 * 100% = 26.24%
```
Then, if we want to calculate the one year or annual return, we simply divided this value by the number of years, 2 years at a value of 13.12% per year.
```
Continuous Annual Return = Absolute Returen/Number of Years = 26.34%/2 = 13.12%
```
The second or (discrete) method involves taking the ratio of the final price divided by the first price minus 1.
```
Discrete Absolute Return = (Final Price/Initial Price) - 1
```
So the way you would do this, is simply to say, $130 divided by $100 - 1 would be equal to 0.3 which is equal to 30%.
```
(130$/$100) - 1 = 0.30 * 100% = 30%
```
So note that the exact same return of $130 gives us 26.24% using the continuously compounded method and 30% using the discrete method.
